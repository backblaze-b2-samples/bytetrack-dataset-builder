# Tech Debt Tracker

Known tech debt items. Agents update this when they discover or create tech debt.

| Description | Impact | Proposed Resolution | Priority | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `datetime.utcnow()` deprecated in Python 3.12+ | Naive datetimes, future breakage | Replace with `datetime.now(UTC)` in `repo/b2_client.py`, `service/metadata.py` | High | Resolved |
| S3 client recreated on every API call | Connection pool wasted, added latency | Cache client as module-level singleton via `lru_cache` | High | Resolved |
| `get_upload_stats()` pagination broken at 1000 objects | Stats silently wrong for large buckets | Check `IsTruncated` + use `ContinuationToken` | High | Resolved |
| `record_upload()` never called | `/metrics` always reports 0 uploads | Call from `runtime/upload.py` after successful upload | Medium | Resolved |
| Metrics counters not thread-safe | Race conditions under concurrent requests | Use `threading.Lock` (matches `service/files.py` pattern) | Medium | Resolved |
| `_humanize_bytes` duplicated in Python (repo + service) | DRY violation, drift risk | Extract to `app/types/formatting.py` shared util | Medium | Resolved |
| `humanizeBytes` duplicated in TypeScript | DRY violation | Extract to `lib/utils.ts` | Low | Open |
| `formatDate` duplicated in TypeScript | DRY violation | Extract to `lib/utils.ts` | Low | Open |
| No bounding box overlay on track clips | Can't visually verify tracking quality; clips show the cropped object but no bbox, track ID, or confidence drawn | Server-side: add `sv.BoundingBoxAnnotator` in `service/engine/clips.py` before encoding (subtract crop offset from bbox coords). Client-side alt: canvas overlay on `<video>` in `track-row.tsx` synced via `timeupdate` + annotation JSON endpoint | Low | Open |
| No test harness for feature specs | No automated verification | Add pytest fixtures + test files per feature | Medium | Resolved (partial — tests added for upload, files, activity, errors) |
